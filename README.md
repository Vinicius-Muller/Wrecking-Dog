# Wrecking Dog

As a gamer and frontend developer, I always wanted to know how difficult it would be to build an application that allows the user to move the interface freely. So, I got an idea to build a game using only vanilla JavaScript with mechanics inspired by one of my favorite series, Super Mario.

## Introduction

"Wrecking Dog" is a game developed using only vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

1. **Point System:** There are multiple enemies in the game which the player has to defeat within a set time using firepower without getting hit.
2. **Responsive Player Controls:** The game controls are minimalistic but very responsive, providing a satisfying feel for each action.
3. **Special Powers:** The player has the ability to control a super dog that can transform itself into a fireball to destroy everything it touches.

## Getting Started

As mentioned before, this project uses only vanilla JavaScript, so no packages are needed. To run it, you only need to open the code in a browser or use a server system like Liver Server.

## Usage

Once the game is started, there is a tutorial section that will teach you how to control the character and use the firepower.
